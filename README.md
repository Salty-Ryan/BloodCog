 * Project: BloodCog - C++ Game README *
 ***************************************/

/*************************************************
 * Introduction:
 * In the haunting realm of BloodCog, players are ensnared by the mesmerizing blend of steampunk aesthetics
 * and Lovecraftian horror. This open-world sandbox game offers an exploration of a meticulously crafted universe,
 * where the dance between automation, encroaching darkness, and consequential choices crafts an immersive,
 * chilling, and infinite journey.
 *************************************************/

/*************************************************
 * Game Concept & Core Mechanics:
 * BloodCog challenges players to construct an intricate network of potent machines. These machines, however,
 * serve a darker purpose: to awaken eldritch demons, setting in motion a series of events that escalate challenges
 * and deepen gameplay progression. The game's essence lies in the balance between the allure of automation and
 * the impending doom of summoning malevolent forces. As players delve deeper into automation, they inadvertently
 * beckon the darkness, creating a palpable tension between progress and peril.
 *************************************************/

/*************************************************
 * World & Setting:
 * The game's landscape is draped in an unsettling fog, painting a desolate yet eerily beautiful tableau where
 * machinery and eldritch energies intertwine. This world is segmented into diverse biomes, each offering unique
 * resources and challenges. These biomes not only incentivize exploration but also introduce the puzzle of integrating
 * newfound resources into existing automation systems. Dynamic environmental challenges, such as tainted rain and
 * extreme temperatures, keep players on their toes. Early on, players navigate this world using steamboats, but as
 * they progress, the skies become accessible via airships.
 *************************************************/

/*************************************************
 * Characters & Creatures:
 * Rather than traditional leveling or skill systems, BloodCog emphasizes player growth through understanding
 * and mastering game mechanics. The true progression is marked by a player's ability to manage resources more
 * efficiently and comprehend the game's deeper mechanics.
 *************************************************/

/*************************************************
 * Gameplay Features:
 * The game's narrative unfolds organically. Instead of direct storytelling, players piece together the world's history
 * through environmental cues, artifacts, and ruins. This approach grants players the agency to interpret and shape
 * their unique narratives. In the multiplayer co-op mode, players can collaborate, allowing for specialization in
 * automation, exploration, or combat.
 * A pivotal aspect of the game is the player's ability to make choices and face their consequences. The game introduces
 * a dynamic system where the intensity of automation directly impacts the spread of darkness. Players can choose the
 * "path of darkness," which, while efficient, wreaks havoc on the environment. Alternatively, they can opt for the
 * "path of steam power," which is resource-intensive but restores life to the world. This choice-driven system ensures
 * that every player's experience is unique, as they navigate the balance between efficiency, safety, and environmental impact.
 *************************************************/

/*************************************************
 * Resource Management and Automation:
 * Resource management is central to gameplay. Players are initially driven to explore and manually gather resources,
 * but as they progress, the focus shifts to automating these processes. The challenge then evolves into effective
 * storage and routing of resources to fuel the ever-growing factory.
 *************************************************/

/*************************************************
 * Replayability and Endgame Content:
 * The game's infinite world ensures that as players venture further, they encounter newer, darker realms. This constant
 * evolution keeps the gameplay fresh and challenging. Progression unlocks advanced automation tools, weapons, and traps,
 * offering varied strategies to combat the terrors of the dark.
 *************************************************/

/*************************************************
 * Additional Features & Ideas:
 * A unique feature is the "Automation and Darkness Gauge," a visual representation of the balance between light and
 * darkness. Players can also tinker with machines, customizing them for efficiency or throughput. The option to summon
 * dark servants adds another layer of strategy: is the convenience of additional help worth the surge in darkness?
 * Procedurally generated eldritch challenges, spectral anomalies, and a dynamic soundtrack further enhance the game's
 * atmosphere, ensuring that BloodCog offers an experience that is both haunting and unforgettable.
